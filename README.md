Please use this link to access the project.

The primary objective is to analyze Airbnb data to reveal insights into user experiences 
and satisfaction levels with the numerous listed stays.


Data Description: 
• The necessary data and data dictionaries are available as CSV files. 
• The Reviews (Reviews.csv) dataset contains information about reviews left for 
Airbnb listings, while the Listings (Listings.csv) dataset contains all relevant 
details about the listed stays. Comprehensive descriptions of each column can 
be found in their respective data dictionary files (Listings_data_dictionary.csv 
and Reviews_data_dictionary.csv).


Airbnb_pbix :
On page 1 of the Airbnb_pbix file, you'll discover an interactive dashboard presenting comprehensive 
city-wise data. Utilize the city slicer feature to effortlessly navigate through the information and 
delve deeper into the specifics of each city (Hover on the city column of "City-wise Average Price" visual to see the 
top rated listings in the city).

Subsequent pages offer additional visualizations to facilitate in-depth analysis of the data.

On Page 6, explore yet another dynamic dashboard showcasing the disparity between hosts with 
over a decade of experience and those with less than ten years. Employ the experience slicer to seamlessly 
filter the data based on the host's level of experience.
